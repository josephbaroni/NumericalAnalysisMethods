# Numerical Analysis Methods

Some methods and solvers for basic numerical analysis. Contains:
Numerical Integration methods,
Interpolation,
Root Finding Algorithms,
Direct and Iterative Linear Algebraic methods,
Numerical solutions to ODE's,
Numerical solutions to PDE's,
and more! I'll continue adding new methods and solvers over time.
